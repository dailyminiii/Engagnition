Engagnition Dataset for ASD Engagement Recognition
Hello, and welcome to the Engagnition repository! 🎉

Engagement is crucial for advancing the cognitive and motor development in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While technologies emphasizing physical interaction and dynamic stimuli have shown promise in boosting engagement and reducing stereotypical behaviors, some solutions, like robots, come with challenges like the need for robotics expertise and high costs. That's where serious games could step in!

🎮 Introducing "Defeat the Monster": Our self-developed serious game tailored to harness the recognition and classification skills of children with ASD.

📊 About the Engagnition Dataset:

Specifically designed for engagement recognition of kids with ASD (Total participants: 57).
Features both physiological and behavioral responses.
Contains expert annotations anchored on a ternary scale, serving as the engagement ground truth.

🔍 Why It Matters:
There's a notable gap in available datasets for this niche - with ours being a unique addition, aiming to provide value to researchers and educators in the field.

Feel free to explore the dataset, and remember, together, we can work towards a more inclusive and understanding world for children with ASD!
